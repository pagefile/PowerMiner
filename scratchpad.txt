Running out of power

The underground research facility (cause why else would it be there?) has been cut off from the surface and supplies are limited.
Your job is to venture into the underground with the new Piloted Excavation Drill to mine resources needed to keep the facilities power
plant online. Fortunately, the power plan is a versatile new model being prototyped at the facility that can process many different fuels.
Your PED has a miniturized version of this reactor, but it's not nearly as efficient so only use it in emergencies when the battery is
too drained to get back to base.

Why not simply drill to the surface? The PED doesn't have enough power to do so, and the shaft would be unstable. We need a real construction
effort to get back to the surface.

Win condition: (Jam) None. Your play will be scored by how long you lasted. Maybe even with resources collected
 (Full Game) Find enough materials to get back to the surface
Lose condition: Base runs out of power and PED battery runs out and no fuel on board.

Mechanics:
Top down, drill into blocks to clear and harvest any valuable materials they have. Traveling through previously drilled areas
takes minimal power. Using the drill takes more power, and the harder a block is the longer it takes to drill.

PED:
The is a slow but constant drain on power for the PED unless it's docked with the base. While docked with the base, it doesn't actually
take extra power from the base.
The PED can use materials mined for fuel, but it's less efficient than taking them back to base. While fuel is burning in the PED, it charges
the battery and allows actions without draining the battery until the fuel is depleted.

Base:
dock at the base to recharge the battery and offload fuel
